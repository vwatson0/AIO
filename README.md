Ongoing project.

The library OptimLibV0 is under developement
Its main content are:
- Tools to track 1D time series with online standard deviation and slope estimate with a Kalman filter
- Tools to use a Gaussian process regressor to predict explanatory variable instant value from proxy values determined by the user and necessiting training.
- Tool to run an online Bayesian Optimization under functionning and stability constraints
